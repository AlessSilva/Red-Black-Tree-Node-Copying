# Red-Black Tree with Node Copying Persistence Technique (Python implementation)  

## Operations:
*INC value* -> Add value to Red-Black Tree  
*REM value* -> Remove value from Red-Black Tree  
*SUC value version* -> Returns in the output.file the successor of value in that version  
*IMP version* -> Returns in the output.file the Red-Black Tree of that version in order, following the pattern "value depth color" (R to Red Node and N to Black Node)

## Execution:
```
.\run.py -f "input.txt"

.\run.py -f "input.txt" -t 1 (to show INC and REM operations in the tree)

```
